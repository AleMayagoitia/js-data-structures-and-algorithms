/**
 * Dynamic Programming
 * 
 * 1 - notice any overlappign subproblems
 * 2 - Focus on the input, in particular its type
 * 3 - Decide what is the trivially smallest input (base cases)
 *      - empty string, empty arrays, numbers like 0 or 1
 * 4.1 - Think recursively to use Memoization
 * 4.2 - Thinl iteratively to use Tabulation
 * 
 * 5 - draw a strategy first
