/**

 * Sorting:
 * 
 * Bubble sort    | Runtime: O(n^2)      always        | Memory O(1)       -> we start at the begining of the array, swap the two elements if the first is greater and repeat until the array is sorted
 * Selection sort | Runtime: O(n^2)      always        | Memory O(1)       -> find the smallest element using a linear scan and move it to the front. Do this until sorted
 * Merge sort     | Runtime: O(n log n)  always        | Memory O(n)       -> divide array in half, sort each of the halves and then merge them back together
 * Quick sort     | Runtime: O(n log n), worst: O(n^2) | Memory O(n log n) -> pick a random element and partition the array, such that all elements that are less than the partition go before
 * Radix sort     | Runtime: O(kn)
