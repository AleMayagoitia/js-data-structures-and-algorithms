// Caching
// Is the process of sorting data into temporary memory 
// so that it can be easily retrivered for later use if it's required again

// Cache design generally considers two of these factors:
// - Temporal locality : A memory location that has been recently accesed is likely to be accessed again
// - Spatial locality  : A memory location near one that has recently been accessed, is likely to be accessed again
